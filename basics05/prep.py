# This is a prep for conditional logic and if-then statements

# Example
color = input ('What is your favorite color? ')

if color == "blue":
    print ('I like blue too!')

# Example with else statement
movie = input ('What is your favorite movie? ')

if movie == "The Lord of the Rings":
    print ('Really! Which one is your favorite?')
else:
    print ("You obviously haven't seen The Lord of the Rings!")
